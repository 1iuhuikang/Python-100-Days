The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Python之禅 Tim Peters

美优于丑
简明优于晦涩
简单优于复杂
复杂优于复杂到爆炸
扁平优于嵌套
间隔优于拥挤
代码要具有可读性
情况再特殊，也不至于特殊到破坏原则
实践优于理论
不要放过任何一个错误，除非你刻意为之
面对未知和歧义，别掷骰子搁那猜
有且只有一件事该去做：找到正确做法
现在开始做比永远不做好
如果你的方案很难解释，坏方案
如果你的方案很好解释，也许好
命名空间很好，多用
